### Abstract

Our main question is how life expectancy changes across the U.S under factors like gender, race, and income distribution. This question is important in acknolwledging the disparities in the U.S and how they can impact the health of disadvantaged groups. To address this we will analyze each of these factors individually and how they might be associated. 


### Introduction  

The health inequality project provides profound insight on the disparities of life expectancy in America based on gender and income. It is important to analyze this data and use the findings to address how everyone can have the equal opportunity to live healthy lives.

_Which gender tends to have a longer unadjusted life expectancy?_

We want to research and understand the extent of which gender affects life expectancy. Identifying the gender differences could help public health officials and policymakers to create policies, raise awareness, and target specific health needs. For instance, if the data demonstrates that men tend to have shorter life expectancies than women, they could develop programs aimed at reducing male focused diseases such as prostate cancer or heart disease. 


_Which gender tends to have a higher mean household income?_

This question helps us understand gender-based income inequalities. By analyzing the data we can discover if men tend to have a higher household income compare to women, which could signify systemic gender-based issues such as wage gaps, disparities in opportunity, or lack of educational access. It is crucial to understand the gender differences in household income in order to design equitable and empowering policies. 

_How does income correlate with life expectancy?_

It is important to understand the trends between income and life expectancy because life is precious and everyone deserves to live to their full extent. The trends help us discover certain groups that are disadvantaged and those that are fully sufficient, allowing us to identify specific factors that contribute to these health inequalities such as healthcare and living conditions. Using this data, people can design programs and policies that address the root causes of health disparities and promote health equity. 


### The Dataset

> Where did you find the data? Please include a link to the data source 

We found the data from a data source project called Health Inequality Project- dataset 1 
https://healthinequality.org/data/ 


> Who collected the data?

  The health and Inequality project
  
> How was the data collected or generated?

The data was collected from history from 1999 - 2014 from tax records to record the income data. They try to identify people by social security records in which they can identify where they are located and the size of their household. This data is collected by the groups from ages of 40 to 76.

> Why was the data collected? 

 The data was collected so that they could be seen to discover the relationship between income and life expectancy as it well established through data that can be shown when collected. With this we can also see the differences in the ways that these can be impacted through data being collected from the social security records and tax.

>How many observations (rows) are in your data?

205 rows  

> How many features (columns) are in the data?  

8 features

> What, if any, ethical questions or questions of power do you need to consider when working with this data?  

When looking at the data we can see the problem with the health inequality that the health system has over minority groups are reciving the help that they need. When we see the impact of the changes we have the question what is the impact of power that health systems have on people and how we can help solve this problem. 
> What are possible limitations or problems with this data?   (at least 200 words)

From looking at the data I think there are a couple of spots where race can be defined as in the data the inequality through the basis of gender in this data. Another problem is that itâ€™s a little outdated that they recorded all this data was from the years 2001-2014. Information from data can change throughout time especially now when were in the year in 2023. Another problem could be is the standard error of race adjusted and life expectancy error that the data has on health care they seem to be the same the same numbers so that can be an error of them to do. Another problem that could be seen in the data is how income correlates with the topic of health inequality with this in the ways that they explained how to they made sure to implement these parts of the data they said that the income of the person does not determine the life expectancy of a person. Another part that I see is when reading the document on methods collecting data is that they leave out people who don't have a tax return or social security record. When puting zero's or leavubg it cna be complicated and questionable within that in the future of the data set being implementing can be a long wrong because we don't get information that we need. Laslty for age it is a little questionable why they chose ages from 40 to 70 as this an age tthat is older whyy can't they include other people from other ages and compare the life expencity and income. If were just chosing a certain age there can be generalixation to this life expectancy by income.  

### Implications

> Assuming you answer your research questions, briefly describe the expected or possible implications for technologists, designers, and policymakers. (at least 150 words)

Some expected impications for policymakers and technologists would include greater awareness about accesibility to healthcare accross the U.S as well as how minority communities may be unfairly treated by the healthcare system. Policymakers can use the trends that we identify to show how certain geographical regions have lower life expectancy as a result of poor healthcare or poor access to fresh produce. For instance, we may see that communities that have a lower income have a lower life expectancy because healthcare is inaccesible to those who cannot afford expensive treatments, tests, and other treatments to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Policies that push for health education and healthcare resources can be backed using our data to demonstrate that life expectancy have association to race and gender. Additionally, individuals who are at a greater risk of health conditions/have lower life expectancycan be identified and take greater measures to maintain a healthy diet and weight. Technologies that cater to these higher risk individuals can then be developed by technologists to improve life expectancies. 

### Limitations & Challenges

>What challenges or limitations might you need to address with your project idea more broadly? Briefly discuss. (at least 150 words)

We have several variable to analyze that we may see association from, but it is difficult to prove causation from our data. It will be challenging to demonstrate that race, gender, and income is directly correlated to life expectancy. These factors also vary from city to city and our data set only considers citizens at the national level. Consequently, we may overlook how geographical location may contribute to lifespan as factors like income are relative to where individuals live. Additionally, the dataset pulls from tax records and social security administration death records which does not include all indviduals residing in the U.S. Undocumented individuals will not be considered when we analyze our data and we may draw conclusions about certain populations that are inconsistent. There is an estimated population 11 million immigrants residing in the U.S and information about their income and lifespan could change many of the conclusions we draw about lifespan in the U.S.
